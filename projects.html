			<h3>Gav &amp; Sam's Wedding invite</h3>
			<h4 class="work-type">Letterpress Project</h4>
		</header>
		<p>Working along side <a href='https://twitter.com/GavWeir' target='_blank'>Gav</a>, a designer and good friend of mine, we made invites for his up and coming wedding. For this, I yet again was able to use <a href='https://twitter.com/GavWeir' target='_blank'>Pinched Post's</a> studio to create an awesome letterpressed wedding invite.</p>
		<p>These were done with a mix of wood and lead type with some lead decorative elements added in to give the invite some extra decoration and printed on 150GSM textured paper.</p>

		<h3>Steadwatch</h3>
		<h4 class="work-type">Fun project</h4>
		<p>This was a small, fun project I through together when I wanted to learn a bit more about js structure, backbonejs and working with different API's.</p>
		<p>The idea came from people posting lyrics and trying to be vauge on their social networks and being able to figure out what they are talking about.</p>
		<p>I started this project out very simply as I have plans to use it to learn more about itteration on projects and adding features in chunks instead of doing it all at once.</p>
		<p>This was doen using backboneJs and the <a href="http://www.lyricsnmusic.com/api" target="_blank">lyricsnmusic api.</a></p>

		<h3>'I love you' A3 Letterpress Print</h3>
		<h4 class="work-type">Letterpress Project</h4>
		<p>A Limited run print (30 made) that I printed in the Pinched post studio for Valentines day as a the start of many limited run letterpress prints I will be doing over the next year.</p>
		<p>This was printed in blue with an overlay of silver to give a slightly rubbed away feeling to the print. It was printed on 300GSM crannes lettra stock with a mix of lead and wooden type.</p>
		<p>If you are interested in owning one of these prints I still have some in stock and they are available for Â£13.</p>
