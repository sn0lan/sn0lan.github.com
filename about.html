	<h2>What I do</h2>
  <p>I am a frontend developer currently working for propeller communications in Rugby UK. I mainly work with html, css &amp; JS.</p>  
  <p>I'm also one half of WP titans where I look after the development of wordpress themes.</p>

  <h2>A bit about me</h2>
  <p>I have a massive passion for the web and more specificaly clean, semantic and reusable code. So much in fact that I have been known to piss a couple of people off.</p>
  <p>I really enjoy working and hacking away at ideas and things that take me out of my comfort zone and working with things I wouldnt usualy get to work with in my day to day goings on.</p>
  <p>I love the industry I work in. The ethos, the craic, the way things happen when people get together and I am always up for getting together for conferences, meetups and hacks to meet more like minded people and work on some fun things. If you have a meetup or hack coming up, give me a shout and I would love to come and participate.</p>
  <p>One other thing I <strong>HATE</strong> fixed widths!</p>
