#A quick thought on squarespace's logo builder

So this week, or maybe sooner because I have only seen it this week, squarespace released a logo editor.

I have seen quite a few people complaining about this. "Its ruining design" blah blah.

Honestly, I dont think it's a bad thing. 

Do you really want someone who is happy/preferes creating something like this using a free online editor as a client?

They are more than likely going to be an absolute nightmare and already have no respect for the skills or time of a designer.

Thats my two cents.

On another note, I think the UI they have done for it is fantastic and I think squarespace's inhouse web team are doing a fantastic job!
